# Firebase Hosting + Functions vs App Hosting - Cost Comparison

## TL;DR

**For your use case: Firebase Hosting + Functions is MUCH cheaper!** ‚úÖ

App Hosting is designed for full-stack frameworks (Next.js, Angular) and has minimum costs even with no traffic. Functions + Hosting only charges for actual usage.

## üìä Cost Breakdown

### Firebase Hosting + Functions (What we set up)

#### Firebase Hosting (Static Files)
- **FREE** on Spark plan
- **Paid tier:** $0.026/GB stored, $0.15/GB transferred
- Your use: HTML, CSS, JS files ‚Üí **~$0-2/month**

#### Cloud Functions
**Pay only for:**
- Invocations: $0.40 per 1M calls
- Compute time: Based on memory √ó duration
- Networking: $0.12/GB egress

**Your actual costs:**
```
Authentication (2GB memory, ~30s):
- 100 calls/month √ó $0.30 = $30

Motor API (256MB memory, ~0.5s):
- 10,000 calls/month √ó $0.01 = $100

Total: ~$130/month
```

**Free tier offsets:**
- 2M invocations/month FREE
- 400,000 GB-seconds FREE
- 200,000 GHz-seconds FREE

**Realistic cost with free tier:**
- Light use (10 auth, 1000 API): **$0-5/month**
- Moderate use (100 auth, 10k API): **$20-40/month**
- Heavy use (1000 auth, 100k API): **$150-300/month**

---

### Use App Hosting ‚ùå (Not for you)

**Best for:**
- Full-stack frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit)
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Always-on applications
- Complex build processes
- Integrated CI/CD from GitHub

**Advantages:**

## üí° Cost Optimization Tips for Functions

### 1. Keep Functions Warm (Optional)
Use Cloud Scheduler to ping every 5 minutes:
```bash
# Prevents cold starts for important endpoints
# Free tier: 3 jobs/month
curl https://your-project.web.app/api/health
```

**Cost:** $0.10/month (if using paid scheduler)
**Benefit:** No cold starts, better UX

### 2. Optimize Puppeteer Memory
```javascript
// In functions/index.js
exports.api = functions.runWith({
  memory: '2GB',        // Required for Puppeteer
  timeoutSeconds: 540,  // 9 minutes max
})
```

### 3. Use Firestore Efficiently
```javascript
// Sessions are small (~1KB each)
// 50k reads/day FREE
// 20k writes/day FREE
// You'll likely stay in free tier
```

### 4. Cache Sessions
```javascript
// Sessions persist in Firestore
// Reuse for 24 hours
// No need to re-authenticate
```

### 5. Use Firebase Free Tier Wisely

**Free every month:**
- 2M function invocations
- 400k GB-seconds compute
- 5GB egress
- 50k Firestore reads
- 20k Firestore writes

**Your usage:**
- 100 auth + 10k API = 10,100 invocations (under 2M ‚úì)
- Compute: ~30GB-seconds (under 400k ‚úì)
- Firestore: ~10k reads (under 50k ‚úì)

**Likely to stay in free tier for moderate use!**

## üîç Detailed Cost Calculator

### Firebase Functions Cost Formula

```
Cost = (Invocations √ó $0.40/M) + 
       (GB-seconds √ó $0.0000025) + 
       (Egress √ó $0.12/GB)
```

### Your Authentication Function
```
Memory: 2GB
Duration: 30 seconds average
Cost per call: $0.000150

Breakdown:
- Invocation: $0.0000004
- Compute: $0.000150 (2GB √ó 30s √ó $0.0000025)
- Egress: ~$0.000001

100 calls = $0.015 (within free tier)
1000 calls = $0.15
```

### Your Motor API Function
```
Memory: 256MB
Duration: 0.5 seconds average
Cost per call: $0.00000032

Breakdown:
- Invocation: $0.0000004
- Compute: $0.00000032 (0.256GB √ó 0.5s √ó $0.0000025)
- Egress: negligible

10,000 calls = $0.032
100,000 calls = $0.32
```
